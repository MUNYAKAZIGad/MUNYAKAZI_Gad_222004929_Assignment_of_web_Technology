                Terrorist and criminal events are phenomena that have always plagued human society. Lately, they have become increasingly 
                frequent at worldwide level, such as have recently occurred in Kenya, in Tanzania, and in Uganda [1]. Unfortunately, despite 
                of the efforts made by governments in collaboration with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), for example, by increasing the 
                presence of human resources during specific public events in specific places, these measures are not always effective to deal 
                with such problems, due to the level of fine granularity, both from the temporal and spatial point of view, with which a 
                criminal event can take place. In fact, it makes it practically unfeasible to predict where, when, and how a crime takes place, 
                in order to avoid it or to be able to react promptly when it occurs. LEAs and Emergency Services (ESs) struggle to protect and 
                help people in need, partially because their structural organization is not flexible enough. Moreover, there is a lack of 
                communication means of the Police Forces (PFs), who do not actually have an effective communication system with the citizens, 
                
                that is “common men” or “common people”, who represent the direct victims of crimes. In the first place, one should be aware of,
                that reducing, if not eliminating, crimes is not only a problem of the governments but of the entire society and, in particular,
                it is directly associated with citizens, whose involvement has not been fully considered in the investigation process yet.</br></br>
                Tracking System refers to the implementation of a technological solution designed to monitor, record, and track criminal activities and 
                individuals involved in criminal behavior. And also system will be used to keep tracking where is the criminal hide which 
                is already inside or into our database where we put all the reported (Criminal) Document of the person (Criminal) who 
                committed crime. System will have person who is specialized in using that software system and User of the system will receive
                document of criminal to be recorded into system (database) in order to find out where he/she hide. System will use Cameras on
                the Road or even residential cameras (But according to the agreement between own of the home and the system own or developer).
                In our daily, Soma people after they committed crime usually they escape in order to avoid being in prison for the crime or 
                they mistake, this software system will help justice to find out where is that person who escape and this system is 
                responsible for maintaining safety of society.</br></br>

                    Here in the statement of the problems we will include all analysis carried out in order to collect all information related to the current system problems. 
                    This is part where person can ask himself different question, in order to try to figure out all possible problems.

                    <span>2.1	Description of the existing System</span>
                    <p>
                        Normally in our daily life when criminal  escape justice they use investigation by tracking or through manual system by interviewing people 
                        who have cross relation with criminal who escape justice, some people who  hesitated by police office or pupils carry out  investigation, 
                        they go in jail without knowing anything about that criminal who escape justice. And when police office didn’t get some basic information 
                        about criminal like his or her relatives or other related information, they slow down task of tracking criminal and that can motivate 
                        criminal escape outside of the country.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <span>2.2	Problems of  the  Current system</span>
                    <p>
                        1.	Slow tracking of criminal, when investigation is carried out, they are slowly correcting some information related to criminal to in order to determine where he or she hides out. It is slow process of correcting information, of course will take time. And also  slow tracking system can be caused by population also involve in investigation, which mean that the large number of pupils who will involve in investigation will make criminal tracking system take long time or not!</br></br>
                        2.	Injustice (Ask person thing he/she didn’t know), in investigation, some pupils meet with injustice through many ways like being asked thing you didn’t ever know. And people can give wrong information to police forces because they want to betray they neighbor according to disagreement they have between them. That can lead to injustice through the investigation process. </br></br>
                        3.	It take long time to track criminal, because that old system it will take long time to catch criminal and when investigation take long time to carry out it increase possibilities of escaping to criminal outside of the country.</br></br>
                        4.	Unnecessary financial budget, through the process of investigation that police office will use vehicles and vehicles needs petro to move and other personal expense which   needed by person in order to survive and carry out what he or she asked to work for.</br></br>
                        5.	Limited scalability: Manual tracking methods may struggle to handle increasing volumes of data as criminal activities grow in complexity and magnitudes. It becomes difficult to maintain accurate and up-to-date records, resulting in higher risk of errors and gaps in information.</br></br>
                        6.	Limited information sharing: In a manual system which is used in old system, sharing information between different law enforcement agencies or departments can be challenging. It often relies on slow and unreliable communication channels, such as phone calls or physical transfers of documents. This lack of efficient information sharing hampers collaborations and coordination, making it difficult to identify links between cases or track criminals across jurisdictions. </br></br>

                    <span>2.3	How the proposed system will work</span>
                    <p>
                        A criminal tracking system works by utilizing various technological components and processes to gather, store, analyze,
                        and share information related to criminal activities and individuals. Here’s an overview of how such a system typically
                        operates: System will have person who specialized to use that system, and police will give system user all basic 
                        information about criminal who escape justice and system user will record that person (criminal) into system. 
                        Because system will work with cameras in different places across the country directly according to how we develop
                        the system and when cameras detect criminal who already in database will communicate with system directly and 
                        system will search into database or system and if that suspended found, system will provide full information of 
                        that person (criminal) like his/her full name, Camera location, where road lead with all attribute attached to that
                        road, where that person found on cameras (camera address) and other related basic information about criminal. System
                        will provide notification to the system user and system user will notify nearby police station in order to catch 
                        that criminal.

                    <span>2.4	Describe other  alternatives</span>
                    <p>
                        Other alternatives can include Geographic information system (GIS):
                        Geographic Information System (GIS): GIS technology combines geographic data with crime-related information to 
                        visualize and analyze crime patterns. By mapping criminal incidents, hotspots, and demographic data, law enforcement 
                        agencies can identify areas of high criminal activity and allocate resources accordingly. GIS tools help in spatial 
                        analysis, crime mapping and predictive modeling.

                <p>
                    After the BRD outlines the business goals and benefits of a project, the team should devise a software requirements 
                    specification (SRS) that identifies the specific features, functions, nonfunctional requirements and requisite use 
                    cases for the software. Essentially, the SRS details what the software will do, and it expands upon or translates the
                     BRD into features and functions that developers understand.</br></br>
                     Software requirements typically break down into:</br>

                            sometimes incorporate these requirements into a BRD, but an application that poses extensive user functionality 
                            or complex UI issues might justify a separate document specific to the needs of the intended user. User 
                            requirements -- much like user stories -- highlight the ways in which customers interact with software.</br>
                            A user requirement in that mold for the industrial laser marking software example looks like: </br></br>
                            "The production floor manager shall be able to upload new marking files as needed in order to maintain 
                            a current and complete library of laser marking images for production use." </br></br>

                        <p>
                            Functional requirements for a criminal tracking system may vary based on specific system design and operational needs. The functional requirements for a system describe what the system should do. These requirements depend on the type of software being developed, the expected users of the software, and the general approach taken by the organization when writing requirements. When expressed as user requirements, functional requirements should be written in natural language so that system users and managers can understand them. Functional system requirements expand the user requirements and are written for system developers. They should describe the system functions, their inputs and outputs, and exceptions in detail. Functional system requirements vary from general requirements covering what the system should do to very specific requirements reflecting local ways of working or an organization’s existing systems. For example, here are examples of functional</br></br> 
                            Domain requirements are derived from the application domain of the system rather than from the specific needs of system users. They may be new functional requirements in their own right, constrain existing functional requirements, or set out how particular computations must be carried out.</br></br>
                            The problem with domain requirements is that software engineers may not understand the characteristics of the domain in which the system operates. This means that these engineers may not know whether or not a domain requirement has been missed out or conflicts with other requirements.</br></br>

                            However, here are some common functional requirements that are typically associated with a criminal tracking system: </br>
                            1.	User authentication: authentication is the process of verifying a user or device before The system will have user authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and manipulate sensitive criminal data. </br>
                            2.	Criminal Data Entry and Update: The system will allow authorized user to enter and update information related to criminal incidents, suspects, victims, witness and other relevant data.</br>
                            3.	Search and retrieval: The system will enable users to search and retrieve criminal records based on various criteria, such as suspect descriptions, incident details, timeframes, or geographic location. The search functionality will be efficient, accurate, and user-friendly.</br>
                            4.	Alerts and Notification: The system should have the capability to generate alerts and notifications based on predefined events or triggers. This includes notifications for new leads, updates on case status, system events, or critical information that require immediate attention. </br>

                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <span style="margin-left: 40px;">3.1.2	Non-Functional requirements</span>
                            <p>
                                Non-functional requirements for Criminal tracking system describe the quality attributes and characteristics that the system should possess to ensure its overall performance, reliability, security and usability. Here are some common non-functional requirements for a criminal tracking system</br></br>
                                Non-functional requirements, as the name suggests, are requirements that are not directly concerned with the specific services delivered by the system to its users. These non-functional requirements usually specify or constrain characteristics of the system as a whole. They may relate to emergent system properties such as reliability, response time, and memory use. Alternatively, they may define constraints on the system implementation, such as the capabilities of I/O devices or the data representations used in interfaces with other systems. Non-functional requirements are often more critical than individual functional requirements. System users can usually find ways to work around a system function that doesn’t really meet their needs. However, failing to meet a non-functional requirement can mean that the whole system is unusable. For example, if an aircraft system does not meet its reliability requirements, it will not be certified as safe for operation; if an embedded control system fails to meet its performance requirements, the control functions will not operate correctly.</br></br>

                                Portability requirement: Portability is a non-functional requirement that focuses on the ability of a criminal tracking system to be easily moved or adopted to different hardware, software or network environments.</br></br>
                                Performance: The system will be able to handle a large volume of concurrent users and data transactions without significant delays or performance degradation. It will provide fast response times for searches, data retrieval and analytical queries. If performance is a critical requirement, the architecture should be designed to localize critical operations within a small number of components, with these components deployed on the same computer rather than distributed across the network. This may mean using a few relatively large components rather than small, finer-grain components. Using large components reduces the number of component communications, as most of the interactions between related system features take place within a component. You may also consider runtime system organizations that allow the system to be replicated and executed on different processors.</br></br>

                                Reliability: The system will be reliable, ensuring that it operates consistently and accurately without unexpected system failures or crashes. It will have backup and recovery mechanisms to minimize data loss and ensure system availability. System reliability is not an absolute value—it depends on where and how that system is used. For example, let’s say that you measure the reliability of an application in an office environment where most users are uninterested in the operation of the software. They follow the instructions for its use and do not try to experiment with the system. If you then measure the reliability of the same system in a university environment, then the reliability may be quite different. Here, students may explore the boundaries of the system and use it in unexpected ways. This may result in system failures that did not occur in the more constrained office environment. Therefore, the perceptions of the system’s reliability in each of these environments are different. The above definition of reliability is based on the idea of failure-free operation, where failures are external events that affect the users of a system. But what constitutes “failure”? A technical definition of failure is behavior that does not conform to the system’s specification.</br></br>

                                Security: The system will incorporate robust security measures to protect sensitive criminal data from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. It will have authentication mechanisms, access controls, data encryptions, and audit trails to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The specification of security requirements for systems has much in common with the specification of safety requirements. You cannot specify safety or security requirements as probabilities. Like safety requirements, security requirements are often “shall not” requirements that define unacceptable system behavior rather than required system functionality. </br></br>

                                However, security is a more challenging problem than safety, for a number of reasons:</br></br>

                                1. When considering safety, you can assume that the environment in which the system is installed is not hostile. No one is trying to cause a safety-related incident. When considering security, you have to assume that attacks on the system are deliberate and that the attacker may have knowledge of system weaknesses. </br>
                                2. When system failures occur that pose a risk to safety, you look for the errors or omissions that have caused the failure. When deliberate attacks cause system failure, finding the root cause may be more difficult as the attacker may try to conceal the cause of the failure. </br>
                                3. It is usually acceptable to shut down a system or to degrade system services to avoid a safety-related failure. However, attacks on a system may be denial-of service attacks, which are intended to compromise system availability. Shutting down the system means that the attack has been successful.</br>
                                4. Safety-related events are accidental and are not created by an intelligent adversary. An attacker can probe a system’s defenses in a series of attacks, modifying the attacks as he or she learns more about the system and its responses.</br>

                                These distinctions mean that security requirements have to be more extensive than safety requirements. Safety requirements lead to the generation of functional system requirements that provide protection against events and faults that could cause safety-related failures. These requirements are mostly concerned with checking for problems and taking actions if these problems occur. By contrast, many types of security requirements cover the different threats faced by a system. </br></br>

                                Firesmith (Firesmith 2003) identified 10 types of security requirements that may be included in a system specification:</br></br>

                                1. Identification requirements specify whether or not a system should identify its users before interacting with them. </br>
                                2. Authentication requirements specify how users are identified. </br>
                                3. Authorization requirements specify the privileges and access permissions of identified users. </br>
                                4. Immunity requirements specify how a system should protect itself against viruses, worms, and similar threats. </br>
                                5. Integrity requirements specify how data corruption can be avoided. </br>
                                6. Intrusion detection requirements specify what mechanisms should be used to detect attacks on the system. </br>
                                7. Non repudiation requirements specify that a party in a transaction cannot deny its involvement in that transaction. </br>
                                8. Privacy requirements specify how data privacy is to be maintained. </br>
                                9. Security auditing requirements specify how system use can be audited and checked. </br>
                                10. System maintenance security requirements specify how an application can prevent authorized changes from accidentally defeating its security mechanisms.</br></br>
                                Of course, you will not see all of these types of security requirements in every system. The particular requirements depend on the type of system, the situation of use, and the expected users.</br></br>

                                Scalability: The system will be scalable to accommodate growing volumes of data and user loads. It will be able to handle increasing numbers of criminal records, user accounts and concurrent system users without significant performance degradation.</br></br>

                                Compliance: The system will adhere to legal and regulatory requirements, including data protection laws, privacy regulations and industry standards. It will ensure compliance with applicable rules and policies governing the handling and storage of criminal data. </br></br>
                                Interoperability: The system will be able to exchange data and interact seamlessly with other system used by law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies and judicial authorities. It will support standardized data formats and communication protocols.</br></br>

                                Performance Monitoring: The system will have built-in monitoring capabilities to track system performance, usage patterns and resource utilization. It will provide system administrators with tools to monitor and analyze system metrics, detect anomalies and optimize system performance.</br></br>

                                Usability: The system will be user –friendly and intuitive, ensuring ease of use for both technical and non-technical users. It should have a well-designed user interface with clear navigation, helpful prompts and efficient workflows.</br></br>

                                Compatibility: The system will be compatible with various hardware, software and network environments commonly used by law enforcement agencies. It will support integration with external system, databases and technologies.</br></br>

                                Space requirements: Space requirements in the context of a criminal tracking system refer to the physical space or storage capacity needed to deploy and operate the system. Here are some non functional space requirements for criminal tracking system: Storage capacity, Backup capacity, data center and Physical documentation.</br></br>

                                Organization requirements: Organization requirement in the context of criminal tracking system refer to the characteristic and capabilities needed to ensure efficient organizational management and utilization of the system. Here are some non functional implementation requirements for criminal tracking system: user role and Permission, User management, workflow and task management and etc.</br></br>

                                Implementations requirements: Implementation requirements in the context of a criminal tracking system Refer to the technical aspects and considerations necessary for successfully implementing and deploying the system: Here are some non functional implementation requirements for a criminal tracking system: technologies (programming language, database and etc) and etc.</br></br>

                                External environment requirements: In this system, external environment refers to the factors and conditions in the system’s external environment that impact its performance, reliability and functionality. Here are some non functional external environment requirements for a criminal tracking system: network connectivity, bandwidth, internet availability and data privacy & protections of laws.</br></br>

                                Privacy requirements are crucial for a criminal tracking system to ensure the protection of individual’s privacy rights and comply with relevant privacy laws and regulations. Here are some non functional privacy requirements for a criminal tracking system: data security, anonymization, data sharing and disclosure, user accountability and privacy by design.</br></br>

                                Safety requirements for a criminal tracking system refers to the measures and considerations needed to ensure the safety of users, individual and the system itself. Here are some non functional safety requirements for a criminal tracking . Safety-critical systems are systems in which it is essential that system operation is always safe. That is, the system should never damage people or the system’s environment, irrespective of whether or not the system conforms to its specification. Examples of safety-critical systems include control and monitoring systems in aircraft, process control systems in chemical and pharmaceutical plants, and automobile control systems.</br></br> 

                                Safety-critical software falls into two classes:</br></br>

                                1. Primary safety-critical software this is software that is embedded as a controller in a system. Malfunctioning of such software can cause a hardware malfunction, which results in human injury or environmental damage. The insulin pump software that I introduced in Chapter 1 is an example of a primary safety-critical system. System failure may lead to user injury. The insulin pump system is a simple system, but software control is also used in very complex safety-critical systems. Software rather than hardware control is essential because of the need to manage large numbers of sensors and actuators, which have complex control laws. For example, advanced, aerodynamically unstable, military aircraft require continual software-controlled adjustment of their flight surfaces to ensure that they do not crash. 2. Secondary safety-critical software this is software that can indirectly result in an injury. An example of such software is a computer-aided engineering design system </br></br>
                                342.  Safety engineering</br>
                                Who’s malfunctioning might result in a design fault in the object being designed. This fault may cause injury to people if the designed system malfunctions. Another example of a secondary safety-critical system is the Men care system for mental health patient management. Failure of this system, whereby an unstable patient may not be treated properly, could lead to that patient injuring him or others. Some control systems, such as those controlling critical national infrastructure (electricity supply, telecommunications, sewage treatment, etc.), are secondary safety critical systems. Failure of these systems is unlikely to have immediate human consequences. However, a prolonged outage of the controlled systems could lead to injury and death. For example, failure of a sewage treatment system could lead to a higher level of infectious disease as raw sewage is released into the environment.</br></br>
                                System: user safety, data protection, emergency situation, system reliability and system monitoring.</br></br>

                                Maintainability: The system will be designed for ease of maintenance and future enhancements. It will have modular components, clear documentation and well-structured code to facilitate system updates, bug fixes and new feature additions.</br></br>

                        description and documentation of the system’s functional and non functional requirements. Requirements specification is 
                        the process of writing down the user and system requirements in a requirements document. Ideally, the user and system 
                        requirements should be clear, unambiguous, easy to understand, complete, and consistent. In practice, this is almost
                        impossible to achieve. Stakeholders interpret the requirements in different ways, and there are often inherent 
                        onflicts and inconsistencies in the requirements. </br></br>

                        natural language supplemented by appropriate diagrams and tables in the requirements document. System requirements may 
                        also be written in natural language, but other notations based on forms, graphical, or mathematical system models can 
                        also be used. Summarizes possible notations for writing system requirements. The user requirements for a system should
                        describe the functional and nonfunctional requirements so that they are understandable by system users who don’t have

                        document should not include details of the system architecture or design. Consequently, if you are writing user 
                        requirements, you should not use software jargon, structured notations, or formal notations. You should write user

                <p>
                    A data flow diagram (DFD) maps out the flow of information for any process or system. It uses defined symbols like 
                    rectangles, circles and arrows, plus short text labels, to show data inputs, outputs, storage points and the routes 
                    between each destination. Data flowcharts can range from simple, even hand-drawn process overviews, to in-depth, 
                    multi-level DFDs that dig progressively deeper into how the data is handled. They can be used to analyze an existing 
                    system or model a new one. Like all the best diagrams and charts, a DFD can often visually “say” things that would be 
                    hard to explain in words, and they work for both technical and nontechnical audiences, from developer to CEO. That’s why
                    DFDs remain so popular after all these years.

                        Data flow diagrams are also categorized by level. Starting with the most basic, level 0, DFDs get increasingly complex as the level increases. As you build your own data flow diagram, you will need to decide which level your diagram will be. 
                        Level 0 DFDs, also known as context diagrams, are the most basic data flow diagrams. They provide a broad view that is
                        easily digestible but offers little detail. Level 0 data flow diagrams show a single process node and its connections 
                        to external entities. For instance, the example shown below illustrates the hotel reservation process with the flow of
                        information between admin and guests.</br></br>

                        Level 1 DFDs are still a general overview, but they go into more detail than a context diagram. In level 1 DFD, the 
                        single process node from the context diagram is broken down into sub-processes. As these processes are added, the 
                        diagram will need additional data flows and data stores to link them together. In the hotel reservation example, this
                        can include adding the room selection and inquiry processes to the reservation system, as well as data stores.</br></br>
                        Figure 2: This data flow diagram represent DFD Level 1 which are still provide general overview of the system but 
                        also they go into more detail than a context of diagram. Brief DFD Level 1 provides detailed information about how the
                        system will and step by step procedures will followed.

                <p>
                    A feasibility study is an assessment and analysis of the practicality and visibility of a proposed project or initiative. 
                    It aims to determine whether the project is technically, financially and operationally feasible. The purpose of a 
                    feasibility study is to provide decision-makers with the necessary information to make informed judgments about proceeding
                    with the project.

                <p>
                    Agile methodologies are a set of principles and practices that promote iterative, collaborative and adaptive approaches to software development. The focus of agile is on delivering value to customers, embracing change and fostering effective teamwork. So agile methodologies, such can be good choice for developing a criminal tracking system. Agile approaches offer several advantages that align well with the needs of a dynamic and complex system like a criminal tracking system.</br></br>
                    The ideas underlying agile methods were developed around the same time by a number of different people in the 1990s. However, perhaps the most significant approach to changing software development culture was the development of Extreme Programming (XP). The name was coined by Kent Beck (Beck 1998) because the approach was developed by pushing recognized good practice, such as iterative development, to “extreme” levels. For example, in XP, several new versions of a system may be developed by different programmers, integrated, and tested in a day. Figure 3.3 illustrates the XP process to produce an increment of the system that is being developed. In XP, requirements are expressed as scenarios (called user stories), which are implemented directly as a series of tasks. Programmers work in pairs and develop tests for each task before writing the code. All tests must be successfully executed when new code is integrated into the system. There is a short time gap between releases of the system.</br></br>

                <div class="sub_unit6">
                    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">6.1	Causes of your selection</div>
                    <p>
                        1. Flexibility and adaptability: Criminal tracking system often requires frequent changes and iterations to accommodate evolving requirements, regulations, and user needs. Agile methodologies provide flexibility and allow for incremental development, making it easier to adapt to changing circumstances throughout the development process.</br></br> 
                        2. User involvement: Agile methodologies emphasize continuous collaboration and feedback from users and stakeholders. In the case of a criminal tracking system, involving law enforcement personnel and users in the development process can ensure that the system meets their specific operational needs and enhances usability.</br></br>
                        3. Iteration development and testing: agile approaches break down the development process into smaller iterations or sprints, allowing for the early delivery of functional increments. This facilitates continuous testing and validation ensuring that, each iteration meets the required standards and quality.</br></br>
                        4. Prioritization and Risk Management: Criminal tracking systems often have a wide range of functionalities and requirements. Agile methodologies enable prioritization of features and functionalities based on their value and urgency, ensuring that the most critical aspects are addressed first. This helps manage risks effectively and enables the development team to deliver value incrementally.</br></br>
                        5. Transparency and communication: Agile methodologies promote transparency and regular communication within the development team and with stakeholders. This fosters a collaborative environment, facilitates early identification of issues, and allows for timely resolution of challenges that may arise during the development process.</br></br>
                        6. Continuous improvement: Agile methodologies encourage continuous learning and improvement. This is particularly valuable for a criminal tracking system, where ongoing enhancements and updates may be necessary to keep up with changing law enforcement practice, technological advancements and regulatory requirements.</br></br>
                        7. Incremental development is supported through small, frequent releases of the system. Requirements are based on simple customer stories or scenarios that are used as a basis for deciding what functionality should be included in a system increment. </br></br>
                        8. Customer involvement is supported through the continuous engagement of the customer in the development team. The customer representative takes part in the development and is responsible for defining acceptance tests for the system. </br></br>
                        9. People, not process, are supported through pair programming, collective ownership of the system code, and a sustainable development process that does not involve excessively long working hours.</br></br>
                        10. Change is embraced through regular system releases to customers, test-first development, refactoring to avoid code degeneration, and continuous integration of new functionality. </br></br>
                        11. Maintaining simplicity is supported by constant refactoring that improves code quality and by using simple designs that do not unnecessarily anticipate future changes to the system.</br></br>

            <p style="margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 50px;">
                In conclusion, a criminal tracking system play a crucial role in law enforcement by providing tools and capabilities to track, manage, and analyze criminal activities. It enables law enforcement agencies to efficiently collect, store and retrieve criminal data, aiding investigations, case management, and decision-making processes. Implementation of a criminal tracking system offers several benefits including improved data accuracy, faster information retrieval enhanced collaboration among agencies, and more effective allocation of resources. By leveraging technologies such as data analytics and integration with external systems, the system can assist in identifying suspects, tracking their movements and facilitating timely and informed decision-making. </br></br>
                While a criminal tracking system can significantly enhance law enforcement capabilities, it is important to strike a balance between effective crime prevention and investigation and the protection of individual rights and privacy. Implementing appropriate safeguards and adhering to privacy regulations are paramount to maintaining public trust and confidence in the system.</br></br>
                In conclusion, a well designed and properly implemented criminal tracking system can be a valuable tool in combating crime, improving public safety and supporting law enforcement agencies in their mission to protect communities. </br></br>
